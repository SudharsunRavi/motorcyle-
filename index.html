        <h2>What is a Motorcycle?</h2>
        <p>A motorcycle is a type of vehicle with two or three wheels that is powered by an internal combustion engine or an electric motor. Motorcycles are designed for the purpose of transportation, touring, or sport and recreational activities. They are typically smaller and lighter than cars, and they are often more fuel efficient. Motorcycles can be operated by a single rider or by a rider and a passenger, and they are typically designed to be ridden on paved roads, although some models can also be used off-road. Motorcycles are operated using handlebars to control steering and braking, and they require the rider to balance on the vehicle while seated or standing. In some countries, a motorcycle license or endorsement may be required to operate a motorcycle.</p>
